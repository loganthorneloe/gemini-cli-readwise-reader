# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We appreciate your help.

## How to Contribute

### Bugs & Features
- **Found a bug?** Open an issue with clear steps to reproduce it.
- **Have an idea?** Open an issue to discuss it before you start coding.

### Development Workflow
1.  **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2.  **Install**: Run `npm install`.
3.  **Branch**: Create a branch for your changes (e.g., `feat/new-filter`).
4.  **Code**: 
    - Use **TypeScript** (Strict Mode).
    - Avoid `any` types.
5.  **Build**: Run `npm run build` to verify everything compiles.
6.  **Pull Request**: Push to your fork and open a PR. Keep your description clear.

### Commits
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Keep it simple and descriptive.
- We like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `fix: handle api errors`), but it's not strictly required.

That's it! Happy coding.
